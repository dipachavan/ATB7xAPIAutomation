Builder Pattern:
  The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step.
  It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step fashion, where the construction process can vary based on the type of product being built.
  The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

  Step by step execution using same reference.

2)HamCrest Assertions(RestAssured Default assertions)->no need to add dependency
3)AssertJ Assertions-> need to add dependency
